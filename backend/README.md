# Tadreeb — Backend

REST API for the Tadreeb training platform. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB (Mongoose)**, **JWT**, and **bcryptjs**.

Roles:

- **student** — registers, logs in, applies while registration is open, removes applications only during registration, tracks status via `GET /applications/my`.
- **company** — logs in only when account access is **Active** (legacy **`Approved`** in old data still allowed until migrated), posts programs, reviews applications, accepts/rejects up to **seat** capacity before the program starts.
- **admin** — creates users, lists entities, manages company request review labels, and controls student/company login access.

## 3. MongoDB setup

See your preferred flow (local `mongod` or Atlas). Set `MONGO_URI` in `.env`.

---

## 4. Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | HTTP port (default **5001**) |
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for signing JWTs |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Optional. Comma-separated allowed frontend origins for production. If unset, CORS reflects any origin (dev only). |

Password policy (register, admin-created users, profile password changes): **8-24** characters, at least **one uppercase letter**, **one lowercase letter**, **one number**, and **one special character** (see `validators.js`).

Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs` before storage. Password fields are excluded from normal Mongoose queries by default and selected only during login comparisons.

---

## 5. Install & run

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev       # nodemon
# or
npm start
```

Health: `GET http://localhost:5001/` → `Tadreeb API is running`.

---

## 6. API overview

Base URL: `http://localhost:5001`  
JSON bodies: `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Auth header (protected routes):**

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```

### Public

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Health |
| POST | `/api/company-requests` | Company join request (no auth). Persists all form fields including description. |

### Auth (`/api/auth`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/student/register` | — | — |
| POST | `/student/login` | — | — |
| POST | `/company/login` | — | — |
| POST | `/admin/login` | — | — |
| GET/PUT | `/student/profile` | Bearer | student |
| GET/PUT | `/company/profile` | Bearer | company |
| GET/PUT | `/admin/profile` | Bearer | admin |

Company login succeeds only when `companyMayUsePortal(status)` is true (**`Active`**, or legacy **`Approved`**).

### Admin (`/api/admin`)

Bootstrap and CRUD as implemented in `adminRoutes.js` (create admin/company/student, list users, update company/student account access, etc.).  
**Company account access** values used for login: **`Pending`**, **`Active`**, **`Inactive`**, **`Rejected`**. Admin accounts remain **`Active`**.

### Opportunities (`/api/opportunities`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Optional Bearer | Public list. `usedSeats` / `availableSeats` count **Accepted** students only (applications do not consume seats until accepted). With Bearer as **owning company** or **admin**, each row may include **`applicantsCount`** (all applications). |
| GET | `/:id` | Optional Bearer | Same seat semantics. |
| POST | `/` | Bearer | company (portal-eligible) |
| PUT | `/:id` | Bearer | company (owner) or admin |
| DELETE | `/:id` | Bearer | company (owner) or admin |

Programs include **`registrationDeadline`**, **`qualifications`** (optional text), title/description/rules/seats/dates, etc. Minimum seats on update cannot go below **accepted** count. Registration deadline must be before the program start date.

### Applications (`/api/applications`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/` | Bearer | student - apply while registration is open (`programID`) |
| GET | `/my` | Bearer | student — list own apps with status |
| DELETE | `/:id` | Bearer | student - remove only while registration is still open |
| GET | `/company` | Bearer | company |
| PATCH | `/:id/status` | Bearer | company - set Accepted/Rejected and note before the program is Active/Completed |

**Application `status`:** `Submitted` · `Under Review` · `Not Reviewed` · `Accepted` · `Rejected`

Automatic status sync:

- `Submitted` while registration is open.
- `Under Review` after registration closes and before the program starts.
- `Not Reviewed` if the program starts and the company has not accepted or rejected.
- `Accepted` / `Rejected` remain final company decisions.

---

## 7. Domain rules (summary)

- **Seats:** Capacity is enforced on **acceptance**, not on the mere count of applicants.
- **Registration deadline:** Students can apply or remove applications only while registration is open.
- **Program lifecycle:** Register Now, Selection Phase, Active, and Completed are derived from registration/start/end dates plus manual completion.
- **Company decisions:** Companies cannot update application status after a program becomes Active or Completed.
- **Company accounts:** Login access is controlled by **Active** / **Inactive** from Admin Users. Only **Active** (or legacy **Approved**) can log in and post programs.
- **Company requests:** Admin Companies uses review labels **Under Review**, **Accepted**, and **Rejected** for inbound request review. This is separate from login access.
- **Student visibility:** Application results are visible by default; admin can hide company status/note from the student.

---

## 8. Quick smoke test (curl)

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:5001

curl -i $BASE/

# Bootstrap admin (lock down in production — see §9)
curl -i -X POST $BASE/api/admin/create-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Root","lastName":"Admin","email":"admin@tadreeb.com","phone":"0500000000","password":"Admin1234!"}'

curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/auth/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@tadreeb.com","password":"Admin1234!"}'

# Create company (replace <ADMIN_TOKEN>) — new companies default to Active if status omitted
curl -i -X POST $BASE/api/admin/create-company \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" \
  -d '{"companyName":"Example Co","email":"co@example.com","password":"Co123456!","industry":"Tech","phone":"0511111111","location":"Kuwait City"}'
```

---

## 9. First-time admin (bootstrap)

`POST /api/admin/create-admin` may be **unprotected** for an empty database. **Re-protect it** before production (`protect`, `allowRoles('admin')` in `adminRoutes.js`).

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `MongooseServerSelectionError` | Mongo not reachable — check `MONGO_URI`, Atlas IP allowlist |
| `jwt malformed` / 401 | Missing `Bearer ` prefix or rotated `JWT_SECRET` — log in again |
| 403 on company routes | Company **Pending** / **Inactive** / **Rejected** - admin must set **Active** |
| 415 on JSON routes | Send `Content-Type: application/json` |
| `EADDRINUSE: 5001` | Free the port or change `PORT` |

---

## 11. Security checklist (production)

1. Strong `JWT_SECRET`; never commit `.env`.
2. Lock bootstrap `create-admin`.
3. Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to real frontend origin(s).
4. TLS in front of the API; rotate secrets if leaked.
